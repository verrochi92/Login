# Login
Login system example using java servlets and jsp

This code was originally part of a group project that wasn't ever fully realized.
This is the basis for account creation for a website, you can register
and activate an account. Uses JSP for the login page and the backend
is a java servlet hooked into a SQL database. Uses Google's Gmail
API to generate registration emails.

Originally, this was going to be used to create a social media platform
intended to be used to plan and find events. Please feel free to use the work
I have here.
